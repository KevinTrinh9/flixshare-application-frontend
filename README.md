Welcome to my Flixshare App!

With this app, I have implemented several features linked to The Movie Database (TMDB) API. As a guest without an account, you are able to see the top 10 most popular movies and TV shows at any given time by clicking the respective links on the homepage. You are also able to search for any movie or TV show you'd like using the search bar.

Please use the search feature by typing in any movie or TV show, and a list will show up with the appropriate results relating to your search query. You can also view a description of the movie or TV show by simply clicking on the poster that appears. Once the search results are displayed, you can navigate through other pages of the results with the pagination buttons at the bottom of the results list, provided there are still other movies or TV shows that match your search query.

Please feel free to create an account as well. To do so, you would just need to enter a proper email address, username, and password. When logging in, you just need to enter your username and password to be able to view your dashboard. In your dashboard, there are now two separate search bars, one for movies and one for TV shows. Please use the appropriate search bar to find any movie or TV show you would like. By having an account, you are able to make lists of your favorite movies and TV shows. You can make as many lists as you want and title them as well.

I chose to implement those features so that users can search for any movie or TV show to find some brief information about them. I also wanted users to be able to create lists of their favorite movies or TV shows to be able to show others.

If you would like to run tests, this application uses Jest.

Here is a link to the API that I used for this project: https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started

Please note that the TMDB API, although up-to-date, can be missing posters and/or information about specific movies or TV shows from time to time.

I used JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js, React.js, JSX, CSS, and PostgreSQL to create my website.

Note: This repository only contains the frontend files. The frontend can be run using 'npm start'.

This is my second capstone project! I hope you find it fun, useful, and easy to use.
